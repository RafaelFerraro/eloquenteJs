  ********* Historical Life Expectancy ************
  When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than
  90 years, only the latest generation in the data came out. Letâ€™s take a closer
  look at that phenomenon.
  Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry
  data set per century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their year
  of death, dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as in Math.ceil(person.died /
  100).
